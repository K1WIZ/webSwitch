# webSwitch

This is a simple PHP webswitch that can be used to call system scripts or commands from a web browser or 
simple GET API (like with Domoticz dummy switches that have http actions).  In this case, I can call these
scripts from my domoticz console on my mobile.

Just place the file in a web server directory and call it from its URL to use.  Make any changes suitable for your
needs and environment.
